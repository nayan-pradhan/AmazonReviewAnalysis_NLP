      "[\"\\n  This monitor is definitely a good value. Does it have superb color and contrast? No. Does it boast the best refresh rate on the market? No. But if you're tight on money, this thing looks and preforms great for the money. It has a Matte screen which does a great job at eliminating glare. The chassis it's enclosed within is absolutely stunning. It features a VGA and and HDMI port. The screen automatically detects signals and turns on when a source is turned on. When the selected source turns off it quickly scans and switches to any other sources. If no connections are available it goes into standby automatically. The power chord is a good 6 or more feet and easy to wrap with half of it being very thin wire. The ON LED is not distracting or too bright. When it's off it looks like a borderless monitor. And unlike what other people say it does have tilt, just not forward or left to right. It stands up straight or leans back. Unfortunately it doesn't have VESA mount holes, but under 100 you can't be that serious about your monitor setup. Small text has some problems fully rendering when using VGA so I recommend using HDMI. If you use the Windows 10 settings to configure how text is displayed though it fixes this, but not all will know how to do that. It doesn't have speaker, and I am thankful that most monitors don't. This monitor has A LOT of settings for gaming, night use, color adjustments, and general settings and all can be saved into 3 different gaming profiles. You can even change what settings appear in the quick menu. When u press any of the menu buttons, the menu pops up and clearly illustrates all the buttons. This monitors menus are super easy to understand and navigate and that's a rarity in its own. Also worth noting; it can display crosshairs and display the monitors current refresh rate. It also packs FreeSync for AMD graphics card users. If you only have DVI, you can get DVI to HDMI chords as long as your computer's video out supports it. The base and monitor couple together with one screw that features a hand flap so you don't need a screw diver if you don't want to use one. It is decently sturdy and the screen doesn't distort even when pressed on with strong pressure. The base is quite large, but wont be a problem for most. I haven't noticed any screen delay compared to my 300 dollar 1ms response time monitor (and I'm pretty picky). It's contrast is a little flat in some scenarios but appears much more dynamic in games, especially with some tweaking. With that said, I like that it looks flat when working on documents because it makes it much easier to focus.All in all, this monitor is filled with a good balance of features and looks like a very solid 1080p 75Hz IPS screen for any monitor under $160, let alone the $80 I paid. If you don't absolutely need a better refresh rate and aren't planning on spending more than 200 dollars then I would say just buy this monitor. It's durable, feature packed, and looks fantastic in all use-case scenarios. I'd give it 1000 stars if I could.\\n\", \"\\n  I've seen many other reviews saying this monitor does not tilt, but it in fact does. I'm guessing people didn't take a close enough look at the hinge mechanism in the base, which attaches to the main display and allows for backwards tilt of approximately 15 degrees. The monitor is very light, thin, has small bezels, and produces reasonably good colors. It doesn't have a vesa mount, but I knew that before purchasing it, and wasn't planning to mount it. For $89, it is a great value.\\n\", \"\\n  Aside from my computer and PS4, this is probably one of the best things I've ever purchased. I use it every single day without error and everything always looks amazing. I'm a broke college kid and really needed something sufficient for PS4, homework, movies, everything really. I was torn between this and the HP pavilion and I have no regrets from picking this one! The screen is definitely big enough (perfect for having multiple pages open for homework) and is insanely vibrant and good quality for the price. I have absolutely no complaints, and even with a horrible $2 thunderbolt to HDMI cable for my Mac, it still looks absolutely amazing.\\n\", '\\n  I bought two of these and enjoy them quite a bit. A few reviews complain about ghosting, which I experienced until I realized in the default settings on the monitors had \"overdrive\" or \"OD\" on. As long as you disable this feature you will no longer have ghosting trouble! Hope this helps anyone who bought these and was disappointed, I saw nothing online about fixing this issue other than figuring it out myself by chance.\\n', '\\n  I just got this monitor few days ago and setting up literally took a minute. Colors are so vibrant and bright. Darks are good and brights are rich.  I work in a IT field and I’ve seen and used a lot of monitors, this is by far the best I’ve used till date. I’ve only used vga and it’s already better than using hdmi in most of the monitors. I can only imagine what it would be after using with an hdmi cable. Its a steal for the price I got.\\n', '\\n  I very rarely write reviews, but am so disappointed with this monitor, that I felt the need to warn others. Originally bought this last year to use for school and work. After a few weeks, started having issues with it turning off and repeatedly blinking in mid-use, as well as dead pixels in the middle of the screen.  Contacted Amazon, and they sent a replacement and I returned the original.  Again, a few weeks of perfect operation. Then on the replacement unit, the power and menu buttons stopped working.  The only way to turn on and off was to physically unplug the unit.  Contacted Amazon again, and they referred me to the manufacturer.  After several attempts, I finally got a hold of a person.  They said they would look at, but I would have to ship it back on my own dime, and they would not replace it.  I declined (mostly because I didn\\'t have a box to pack it in, and was severely unimpressed with customer service).So I continued using it for several months with few issues. I stopped using it earlier this year, mostly because I got tired of the physical unplugging, and started using an old TV instead.  Just now, went to fire it up again for my wife to use.  After not touching or using it for the last few months, the screen is cracked in the middle, and as far as I\\'m concerned is unusable.  And no, this is not a case of \"oops  I dropped it and now I\\'m going to blame the hardware.\"  I have other Acer electronics, and have been for the most part satisfied, but this monitor has been nothing but problems.  Would rate less than 1 star if possible.\\n', \"\\n  I am somewhat satisfied with my purchase. The price was great, and looks great too. Easy to assemble. Came with vga and power cord. Colors look amazing, no annoying power indicator lights. The options menu is very easy to navigate. I didn't want to do this, but I had to dock a star as it lacked the ability to tilt. It's at a permanent position so I'm gonna have to stack an extra book below to go the position I want. Otherwise, 10/10\\n\", \"\\n  This monitor really knocked my socks off!  I was expecting just another monitor, like my old one.  I needed a new one for my wife so I grabbed this.  It isn't kidding when they say it is thin.  It's very light weight, which doesn't matter to me much.  The colour quality is top notch and response is perfect, no blurriness or anything.  But what surprised me is that I will sometimes watch videos on it, and when I do, I will move to a livingroom chair I have in the corner to watch it which sits lower.  With my old monitor that would make the video much darker and I would have to adjust it so that the monitor was facing almost directly at me to get a good image.  With this one, I sat down and the image was just fine without even turning it or angling it down or anything!!!  It didn't get darker, very minimal glare on it.  The black is nice and black like it should be (with some nice options in the monitor settings to adjust the blackness).  It has a ton of settings for the monitor.  The refresh rate of 75 is nice.  I'm a casual gamer and it is perfect for that, the colours in my game really looked nice.  I can't say enough about this, I was FINALLY pleasantly surprised (as opposed to so much I have purchased that didn't work).  Well worth the money by far!\\n\", 'Exact value for money, you pay for this monitor, greatly a monitor of 6Bits + FRC is not 8 truly bits, this serves for gaming for the quick response you have but not to see good colors, not really It has good colors, in general they look wishes but I can not ask for more for this low price. As soon as angles of vision ... you have to be straight to him, you can not see it anywhere because you will see the bleeding of backlight or the even more unlawned colors, it has a very good glitter, of echo hurts you if you put it to the fullest At night, it is extremely bright. By default my NVIDIA card detects it as a 75Hz monitor, hiding the other modes of 60 Hz 50 Hz 30Hz 25Hz 24 Hz 23.7 Hz. It has good sharpness and has good black but I repeat, there is a backlight bleeding even if it is not so severe and I repeat it is good for gaming not for vivid colors or watching movies with vibrant and pretty colors. What if it bothers me about these panels is that neither on the official page mention the fact that it is 6 bits and not 8, which if it marks a big difference in dynamic range and colors, if in case 8 bits has poor colors , Imagine 6bits: terrible. ', \"\\n  Edit of my original review.Is this the greatest monitor? Probably not. Do I use it fine? Of course. If you want perfect brightness distribution then go buy another monitor. The two bottom corners have noticeable bright spots that can be a bit distracting when the monitor is displaying darker backgrounds. Overall, I'm giving this monitor 5/5 because it works great. I use it to play games and have no complaints.I've never had a higher refresh rate than 60Hz but I personally wouldn't spend too much more on any higher because I find games are playable at this refresh rate and FPS it provides. Would I spend more money on a higher resolution and higher refresh rate eventually? Maybe. But for now, this works great.Buy this monitor if you're not too serious about insane detail.\\n\", 'I bought this monitor for the simple fact that it was a 1080p 75Hz of Acer. I was surprised that these features were only 1,700mxn. I did not expect much from him, but in these three months he gave me a great surprise. The monitor is incredibly light and thin. The source of power is external, which saves costs and helps its general aesthetics.Clemple with everything, the Full HD, 75Hz, and is IPS (I have not tried freesync, I do not use AMD) Pros: + It is very light, It greatly facilitates the cleaning of the desk and transport. + cost / benefit, is the best you can find, surpassing 1080p60hz + monitors have several customizable profiles and you can alternate each other easily. + has about 30 degrees tilt for better visualization. -The base is a lightweight and cheap plastic. Although for the weight of the monitor, it does not need more.-By Default has a very annoying green filter. But it is fixed in 10 minutes correcting the color.-The buttons have them at the bottom, it costs some work to move on the blind menu, and the shutdown button is equal to all the other buttons. He has a black edges that It makes it seem that it is not giving the total resolution, but you get used easily. Recommending this 100% monitor extensively. ', '\\n  To begin with, the monitor went to me for a very long time due to a delivery company error, but the seller sent me a new one without any problems.  I was surprised that it is so thin and light.

No. Does it boast the best refresh rate on the market? No. But if you're tight on money, this thing looks and preforms great for the money. It has a Matte screen which does a great job at eliminating glare. The chassis it's enclosed within is absolutely stunning. It features a VGA and and HDMI port. The screen automatically detects signals and turns on when a source is turned on. When the selected source turns off it quickly scans and switches to any other sources. If no connections are available it goes into standby automatically. The power chord is a good 6 or more feet and easy to wrap with half of it being very thin wire. The ON LED is not distracting or too bright. When it's off it looks like a borderless monitor. And unlike what other people say it does have tilt, just not forward or left to right. It stands up straight or leans back. Unfortunately it doesn't have VESA mount holes, but under 100 you can't be that serious about your monitor setup. Small text has some problems fully rendering when using VGA so I recommend using HDMI. If you use the Windows 10 settings to configure how text is displayed though it fixes this, but not all will know how to do that. It doesn't have speaker, and I am thankful that most monitors don't. This monitor has A LOT of settings for gaming, night use, color adjustments, and general settings and all can be saved into 3 different gaming profiles. You can even change what settings appear in the quick menu. When u press any of the menu buttons, the menu pops up and clearly illustrates all the buttons. This monitors menus are super easy to understand and navigate and that's a rarity in its own. Also worth noting; it can display crosshairs and display the monitors current refresh rate. It also packs FreeSync for AMD graphics card users. If you only have DVI, you can get DVI to HDMI chords as long as your computer's video out supports it. The base and monitor couple together with one screw that features a hand flap so you don't need a screw diver if you don't want to use one. It is decently sturdy and the screen doesn't distort even when pressed on with strong pressure. The base is quite large, but wont be a problem for most. I haven't noticed any screen delay compared to my 300 dollar 1ms response time monitor (and I'm pretty picky). It's contrast is a little flat in some scenarios but appears much more dynamic in games, especially with some tweaking. With that said, I like that it looks flat when working on documents because it makes it much easier to focus.All in all, this monitor is filled with a good balance of features and looks like a very solid 1080p 75Hz IPS screen for any monitor under $160, let alone the $80 I paid. If you don't absolutely need a better refresh rate and aren't planning on spending more than 200 dollars then I would say just buy this monitor.

I use it every single day without error and everything always looks amazing. I'm a broke college kid and really needed something sufficient for PS4, homework, movies, everything really. I was torn between this and the HP pavilion and I have no regrets from picking this one! The screen is definitely big enough (perfect for having multiple pages open for homework) and is insanely vibrant and good quality for the price. I have absolutely no complaints, and even with a horrible $2 thunderbolt to HDMI cable for my Mac, it still looks absolutely amazing.\\n\", '\\n  I bought two of these and enjoy them quite a bit. A few reviews complain about ghosting, which I experienced until I realized in the default settings on the monitors had \"overdrive\" or \"OD\" on. As long as you disable this feature you will no longer have ghosting trouble! Hope this helps anyone who bought these and was disappointed, I saw nothing online about fixing this issue other than figuring it out myself by chance.\\n', '\\n  I just got this monitor few days ago and setting up literally took a minute. Colors are so vibrant and bright. Darks are good and brights are rich.  I work in a IT field and I’ve seen and used a lot of monitors, this is by far the best I’ve used till date. I’ve only used vga and it’s already better than using hdmi in most of the monitors. I can only imagine what it would be after using with an hdmi cable. Its a steal for the price I got.\\n', '\\n  I very rarely write reviews, but am so disappointed with this monitor, that I felt the need to warn others. Originally bought this last year to use for school and work. After a few weeks, started having issues with it turning off and repeatedly blinking in mid-use, as well as dead pixels in the middle of the screen.  Contacted Amazon, and they sent a replacement and I returned the original.  Again, a few weeks of perfect operation. Then on the replacement unit, the power and menu buttons stopped working.  The only way to turn on and off was to physically unplug the unit.  Contacted Amazon again, and they referred me to the manufacturer.  After several attempts, I finally got a hold of a person.  They said they would look at, but I would have to ship it back on my own dime, and they would not replace it.  I declined (mostly because I didn\\'t have a box to pack it in, and was severely unimpressed with customer service).So I continued using it for several months with few issues. I stopped using it earlier this year, mostly because I got tired of the physical unplugging, and started using an old TV instead.  Just now, went to fire it up again for my wife to use.  After not touching or using it for the last few months, the screen is cracked in the middle, and as far as I\\'m concerned is unusable.  And no, this is not a case of \"oops  I dropped it and now I\\'m going to blame the hardware.\"  I have other Acer electronics, and have been for the most part satisfied, but this monitor has been nothing but problems.  Would rate less than 1 star if possible.\\n', \"\\n  I am somewhat satisfied with my purchase. The price was great, and looks great too. Easy to assemble. Came with vga and power cord. Colors look amazing, no annoying power indicator lights. The options menu is very easy to navigate. I didn't want to do this, but I had to dock a star as it lacked the ability to tilt. It's at a permanent position so I'm gonna have to stack an extra book below to go the position I want. Otherwise, 10/10\\n\", \"\\n  This monitor really knocked my socks off!  I was expecting just another monitor, like my old one.  I needed a new one for my wife so I grabbed this.  It isn't kidding when they say it is thin.  It's very light weight, which doesn't matter to me much.  The colour quality is top notch and response is perfect, no blurriness or anything.  But what surprised me is that I will sometimes watch videos on it, and when I do, I will move to a livingroom chair I have in the corner to watch it which sits lower.  With my old monitor that would make the video much darker and I would have to adjust it so that the monitor was facing almost directly at me to get a good image.  With this one, I sat down and the image was just fine without even turning it or angling it down or anything!!!  It didn't get darker, very minimal glare on it.  The black is nice and black like it should be (with some nice options in the monitor settings to adjust the blackness).  It has a ton of settings for the monitor.  The refresh rate of 75 is nice.  I'm a casual gamer and it is perfect for that, the colours in my game really looked nice.  I can't say enough about this, I was FINALLY pleasantly surprised (as opposed to so much I have purchased that didn't work).  Well worth the money by far!\\n\", \"Exact value for money, you pay for this monitor, greatly a monitor of 6Bits + FRC is not 8 truly bits, this serves for gaming for the quick response you have but not to see good colors, not really It has good colors, in general they look wishes but I can not ask for more for this low price. As soon as angles of vision ... you have to be straight to him, you can not see it anywhere because you will see the bleeding of backlight or the even more unlawned colors, it has a very good glitter, of echo hurts you if you put it to the fullest At night, it is extremely bright. By default my NVIDIA card detects it as a 75Hz monitor, hiding the other modes of 60 Hz 50 Hz 30Hz 25Hz 24 Hz 23.7 Hz. It has good sharpness and has good black but I repeat, there is a backlight bleeding even if it is not so severe and I repeat it is good for gaming not for vivid colors or watching movies with vibrant and pretty colors. What if it bothers me about these panels is that neither on the official page mention the fact that it is 6 bits and not 8, which if it marks a big difference in dynamic range and colors, if in case 8 bits has poor colors , Imagine 6bits: terrible.es My first monitor and I do not have much money then it's worth it. That if I'm impressed with how thin the panel is but it is not very nice to say. \", \"\\n  Edit of my original review.Is this the greatest monitor? Probably not. Do I use it fine? Of course. If you want perfect brightness distribution then go buy another monitor. The two bottom corners have noticeable bright spots that can be a bit distracting when the monitor is displaying darker backgrounds. Overall, I'm giving this monitor 5/5 because it works great. I use it to play games and have no complaints.I've never had a higher refresh rate than 60Hz but I personally wouldn't spend too much more on any higher because I find games are playable at this refresh rate and FPS it provides. Would I spend more money on a higher resolution and higher refresh rate eventually? Maybe. But for now, this works great.Buy this monitor if you're not too serious about insane detail.\\n\", 'I bought this monitor for the simple fact that it was a 1080p 75Hz of Acer. I was surprised that these features were only 1,700mxn. I did not expect much from him, but in these three months he gave me a great surprise. The monitor is incredibly light and thin. The source of power is external, which saves costs and helps its general aesthetics.Clemple with everything, the Full HD, 75Hz, and is IPS (I have not tried freesync, I do not use AMD) Pros: + It is very light, It greatly facilitates the cleaning of the desk and transport. + cost / benefit, is the best you can find, surpassing 1080p60hz + monitors have several customizable profiles and you can alternate each other easily. + has about 30 degrees tilt for better visualization. -The base is a lightweight and cheap plastic. Although for the weight of the monitor, it does not need more.-By Default has a very annoying green filter. But it is fixed in 10 minutes correcting the color.-The buttons have them at the bottom, it costs some work to move on the blind menu, and the shutdown button is equal to all the other buttons. He has a black edges that It makes it seem that it is not giving the total resolution, but you get used easily. Recommending this 100% monitor extensively. ', '\\n  To begin with, the monitor went to me for a very long time due to a delivery company error, but the seller sent me a new one without any problems.  I was surprised that it is so thin and light.  In size to me just right.  the picture is very juicy and does not bother your eyes, after the old monitors it’s quite nice to see a very colorful picture, the same bonus is that there are 75 hertz and this is REALLY felt in games.  Of the minuses, I can only say that in the lower left part of the screen, when the black picture appears, the light is visible there, but this is only when you turn on the black background, and everything is in order.  So for the overall impression of delivery and to the quality of the goods, I will put 4.\\n']\n"
